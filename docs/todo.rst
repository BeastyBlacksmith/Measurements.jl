How Can I Help?
---------------

Have a look at the `TODO`_ list below and the bug list at
https://github.com/giordano/Measurements.jl/issues, pick-up a task, write great
code to accomplish it and send a pull request. In addition, you can instruct
more mathematical functions to accept ``Measurement`` type arguments.  Please,
read the technical appendix in order to understand the design of this package.
Bug reports and wishlists are welcome as well.

TODO
~~~~

- Add pretty printing: optionally print only the relevant significant digits
  (`issue #5 <https://github.com/giordano/Measurements.jl/issues/5>`__)
- Other suggestions welcome ``:-)``
